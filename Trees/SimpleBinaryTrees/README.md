[BinaryTreeBalanceCheck](https://github.com/karthiksagarmv/Disco-DS/edit/master/Trees/SimpleBinaryTrees/BinaryTreeBalanceCheck.java)

Java Solution to check if given tree is balanced. The code computes the height in recursion call.

**Variants**: This code can be modified to compute the height of every node in its class in single traversal.

[BinaryTreeSymmetry](https://github.com/karthiksagarmv/Disco-DS/edit/master/Trees/SimpleBinaryTrees/BinaryTreeSymmetry.java)

Java Solution to check symmetry of given binary tree. A tree is symmetric if we split the tree into vertical half, the two parts are mirror images with respect to structure and data
